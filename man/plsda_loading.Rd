\title{Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) loading}
\description{
This function computes partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) loading from the result of the 'pls_da' function.
}
\usage{
plsda_loading(plsda)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{plsda}{

  The following variables (P,T) are included in the plsda object.

P: A matrix containing the PLS-DA loadings for each explanatory variable in the columns, before transformation.

T : A matrix with PLS-DA score for explanatory variable in each column

  }
}
\details{
The PLS-DA loading and the p-value by statistical hypothesis testing is added to the pls object returned by the 'pls_da' function in this package.
}
\value{

  The return value is a list object that contains the following elements:

  R : PLS-DA loading (Correlation coefficient between PLS-DA score of explanatory variable and each variables in data matrix.)

  p.value : p-value of PLS-DA loading
