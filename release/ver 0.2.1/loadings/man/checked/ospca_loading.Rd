\title{Orthogonal smoothed principal component loading}
\description{
This function computes orthogonals smoothed principal component (OS-PC) loading from the result of the "os_pca" function.
This is also wrapper function of pls_loading function.
}
\usage{
ospca_loading(ospca)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ospca}{

  The following variables (P,T,Q and U) are included in the ospca object.


  P : A matrix with OS-PC loading in each column

  T : A matrix with OS-PC score in each column

  MT : A matrix with averaging OS-PC score for repeated data in each column
  (If not for repeated data, the matrix MT equals to the matrix T)

  Q : A matrix with OS-PC loading for auxiliary variable in each column

  U : A matrix with OS-PC score for auxiliary variable in each column

  }
}
\details{
The OS-PC loading and the p-value by statistical hypothesis testing is added to the ospca object returned by the "os-pca" function.
}
\value{

  The return value is a list object that contains the following elements:

  R : OS-PCA loading (Correlation coefficient between OS-PC score of auxiliary variable and each variables in data matrix.)

  p.value : p-value of OS-PCA loading
