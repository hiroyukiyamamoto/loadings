\title{Partial least squares rank order of groups loading}
\description{
This function computes partial least squares rank rder of groups (PLS-ROG) loading from the result of the "pls_rog" function.
PLS-ROG loading can also be computed from the result of the "pls_rog" function.
}
\usage{
plsrog_loading(plsrog)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{plsrog}{

  The following variables (P,T,Q and U) are included in the plsrog object.

  P : A matrix with PLS-ROG loading for explanatory variable in each column

  T : A matrix with PLS-ROG score for explanatory variable in each column

  Q : A matrix with PLS-ROG loading for response variable in each column

  U : A matrix with PLS-ROG score for response variable in each column

  }
}
\details{
The PLS-ROG loading and the p-value by statistical hypothesis testing is added to the pls object returned by the "pls_rog" function in this package.
}
\value{

  The return value is a list object that contains the following elements:

  R : PLS-ROG loading (Correlation coefficient between PL-ROG score of response variable and each variables in data matrix.)

  p.value : p-value of PLS-ROG loading
