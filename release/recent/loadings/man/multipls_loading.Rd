\title{Multiset partial least squares loading}
\description{
This function computes multiset partial least squares (PLS) loading from the result of the "multipls_geigen" function.
}
\usage{
multipls_loading(multipls)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{multipls}{

  The following variables (P,T,Q and U) are included in the multipls object.

  P : A list of matrix with Multiset PLS coefficients for the explanatory variables in each column for each dataset

  T : A list of matrix with Multiset PLS scores for the explanatory variables in each column for each dataset

  Q : A matrix with Multiset PLS coefficients for the response variable in each column

  U : A matrix with Multiset PLS scores for the response variable in each column

  tau : Matrix for strength parameter of the connection between omics datasets or between omics dataset and group information.

  }
}
\details{
The multiset PLS loading and the p-value by statistical hypothesis testing is added to the multipls object returned by the "multipls_geigen" function in this package.

}
\value{
The return value is a list object that contains the following elements:

Score : A list of matrix with Multiset PLS score for auxiliary variable in each column for each dataset

R : A list of matrix with Multiset PLS loadings in each column for each dataset

p.value : A list of matrix with p-value of multiset PLS loading in each column for each dataset
