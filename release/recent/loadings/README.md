Statistical hypothesis testing of loadings in multivariate analysis.

**loadings**  provides functions for computing loading and its statistical hypothesis testing in principal component analysis and partial least squares.

- Principal component (PC) loading can be calculated from the result of the "prcomp" function. (The "loadings" function in **stats** can usually be applied only to the "princomp" function.) We can also calculate the *p*-value by statistical hypothesis testing for PC loading [1].  

- Partial Least Squares (PLS) [2] (also named as Naive PLS [3]) can be computed by "pls_svd" function in loadings package. PLS loading and *p*-value by statistical hypothesis testing can be computed. PLS loading can also be computed from the result of the "pls_eigen" function in **chemometrics**.  

- PLS-ROG (partial least squares rank order of groups) [3], which is a suitable PLS when the groups are ordered, can be calculated. Their loading and *p*-values can also be calculated.  

- OS-PCA (orthogonal smoothed principal component analysis), which is a suitable PCA when the samples are ordered, can be calculated. Their loading and *p*-values can also be calculated.

- Multiset PLS and Multiset PLS-ROG [5] integrate multi-omics data. Their loading and *p*-values can also be calculated.

- One-sided kernel PCA [6], which is a partially nonlinear extention of PCA by kernel method, can be calculated. Their loading and *p*-values can also be calculated.

- Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) [7] can be calculated. Their loading and *p*-values can also be calculated.

- Regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA) [8] for discriminant analysis  can be calculated. Their loading and *p*-values can also be calculated.
